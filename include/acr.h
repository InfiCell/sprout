/// Class tracking state required for Rf ACR messages.  An instance of this
/// class is created for each SIP transaction that requires accounting, and
/// the class is passed messages and other data during processing of the
/// transaction, and finally triggered to send the ACR message to Ralf.
///
/// In general there is a one-to-one mapping between SIP transactions and
/// ACR objects, with a few exceptions.
///
/// -   When an S-CSCF is invoking application servers for originating or
///     terminating services, a single ACR object is associated with all
///     the S-CSCF SIP transactions involved in the application server chain.
///
/// -   When a single Sprout instance performs multiple IMS functions within a
///     single SIP transaction, multiple ACR's may be associated with that
///     SIP transaction.  The specific cases here are
///     -   when a single Sprout handles both the originating and terminating
///         S-CSCF side of a call
///     -   when Sprout has I-CSCF function enabled and it performs I-CSCF
///         routing to the terminating S-CSCF on the same Sprout instance
///         that performed originating S-CSCF processing
///     -   when Sprout has BGCF function enabled and it performs BGCF routing
///         on the same Sprout instance that performed originating S-CSCF
///         processing.
